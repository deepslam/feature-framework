Project is opened for pull requests.
Any help would be appreciated.

Fully typed feature driven framework written completely with TypeScript.
It was developed to fits daily needs any frontend parts and mobile apps written with JS.

The main idea lies that eveyrthing is a feature. You define your app, define features which your application will you and craft your app.

This package provide you a central point for the whole application. You can access to any feature with convenient interfaces in your app. Events, data providers, data collections, models, views, redux integration - everything is included.

Feature framework has different implementations for React and React Native. They are presented as standalone packages.

In the most cases you don't need to import many file, just one app is enough.
